# README

This is a small application for invoicing. It uses Devise for authentication and has an onboarding feature for new subscribers. You can generate PDFs for the invoices. I will be modifiying it to instead of having the option to delete, better to have archived and a section to manage archived items, clients, and invoices.

## Installation

Ruby 3.1.2, Rails 7.0.4, and Postgres required. 

It uses the letter_opener gem to view emails generated by the app (http://localhost:3000/letter_opener), specially needed to confirm new accounts. You can change this configuration at config/environments/production.rb or development.rb.

You need to setup database credentials to use local environmental variables or set them directly at config/database.yml
